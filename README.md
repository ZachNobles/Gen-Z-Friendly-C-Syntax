# Gen-Z-Friendly-C-Syntax

In today's world, Gen Z communicates with a dialect of English so strange that it seems foreign to older people. But, similarly, the language of older generations can be hard for Gen Z to understand. C++ is almost 40 years old, and English has changed since then, which is why we are proud to introduce **Gen Z-friendly C++ syntax.**

Now Gen Z can program in a way that feels familiar to them using our cutting edge (I made it in an hour) Gen Z-translation macros (define statements)

also included is a translator, which takes a cpp file as an input and translates it either to Gen Z syntax or normal C++ syntax. You can use it like this:
```console
./translator.exe [input_file.cpp] [genz/cpp]
```
It requires that the syntax header file be in the same directory.


Stop programming like an old person today with Gen Z-Friendly C++
